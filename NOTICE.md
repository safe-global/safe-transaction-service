# NOTICE - Ownership and Licensing Split (SEF -> Safe Labs)

This repository is part of the Safe ecosystem and contains code owned and
licensed under two different regimes, split by a cut-over date.

## 1) Up to and including 2026-02-16

- Owner: Safe Ecosystem Foundation (SEF)
- License: MIT
- Tag: `sef-mit-final` (final SEF/MIT snapshot)

## 2) From 2026-02-17 onward

- Owner: Safe Labs GmbH
- License: Functional Source License v1.1 (MIT Future License) (`FSL-1.1-MIT`)

## Why this exists

Safe Ecosystem Foundation continues to steward public-good components of the
Safe ecosystem. Safe Labs GmbH operates and commercially supports
production-grade infrastructure and services.

This split is intended to provide:
- continued permissive availability of the historical MIT code
- sustainable, security-focused development of operational services
- clear terms for contributors and downstream users
